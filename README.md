# VolumePopup
This is an application written in c++ and qt 5.5 which provides a volume popup which could remind to os x for windows. 

See the release for a prebuild version. 

Any feedback to this would be apreciated. ( Yeah i know the code is by far not perfect and has still some way to go to count as good but what the hack it works )
